# 1: ENTRANCE HALL
A long corridor with four open rooms, two on either side. The hallway ends at a large, barred door made of stone, leading to 6: FALSE KING’S TOMB.

# 2: GUARD TOMBS
These small rooms are identical in size and content. They both contain a wooden coffin with a clay statue of a snake-man warrior inside. The statues are hollow. Each contains a gold amulet worth 1gp, a dried snake skeleton, and a cloud of poison gas (d6 damage, can only reduce a PC to 0 HP).

## Lessons: the dungeon is organized. There are patterns. There is hidden treasure. There is also hidden danger. The PCs will probably approach the 2nd coffin with more caution, and earn their reward (gold) without the danger (poison) by using their brains (and a rock or long stick).

# 3: SCHOLAR TOMB
Similar to 2: GUARD TOMBS, but inside the coffin is a clay statue of a thin and sly-looking snake-man scholar. Its scrolls have crumbled to dust. The statue contains the same amulet, snake skeleton, and poison as the others.

# 4. SORCERER TOMB
Similar to 2: GUARD TOMBS, but inside the coffin there is a clay statue of a robed snake-man sorcerer wearing a silver ring. If the PCs didn’t already learn that the other statues were hollow, they’ll almost certainly try to pry the ring off, breaking the statue open and revealing the poison gas and amulet.

The ring is a magical, but also cursed. If worn on a finger, the fingernail becomes long, bifurcated, and pointed like twin fangs. It can be used like a poison dagger (living targets must Save vs. Poison or take +1d6 poison damage on a hit), but each morning, the wearer must Save vs. Poison or take d6 damage. If they take 6 damage at once from the poison ring, their finger falls off and turns into a snake.

## Lessons: Hidden treasure can be magical, useful, and sometimes cursed.

# 5: DOOR/HAMMER TRAP
A large door, barred with a lengthy piece of stone hung on two iron pegs set into either side of the doorframe. Requires at least three PCs to lift (or, if the party is smaller, all PCs). When the bar is lifted, the iron pegs begin to rise. When the bar is fully removed a trap is activated. A huge stone hammer swings down from the ceiling, aiming straight for the backs of the now-trapped PCs. It nearly fills the corridor, but there is a small gap on either side. The PCs can: 1. Save to Dodge OR 2. Use another PC as a springboard, giving them +2 to Dodge but giving the shoved PC –2.

PCs hit by the hammer automatically die (or take serious damage, like 2d6+4).
This trap can be identified by examining the door or pegs, by noticing that the iron pegs slowly rise as the bar is lifted, or by checking the ceiling. If the bar is quickly replaced, if the pegs are held down, or if the trap mechanism in the ceiling is damaged, the trap will not activate.

## Lessons: there are deadly traps. The dungeon can be lethal.

After firing, the hammer slowly retracts into the ceiling unless blocked. It can be reactivated by lifting up the iron pegs, either by hand or by a rope. Its first activation knocks open the stone doors leading to 6: FALSE KING’S TOMB.

# 6. FALSE KING’S TOMB
The burial chamber of a decoy snake-man king and his two brides. On the north wall are three wooden coffins painted with stylized sleeping snake-men. The coffin in the middle is larger and more ornate. Each coffin contains a Skeleton (HD 2, MORALE 12, ATK 1d6 [Claw]) who will immediately attack if their rest is disturbed.

## Lessons: there are undead in the dungeon. They take less damage from slashing weapons. PCs can use the environ- ment against them (lure them into the hammer trap).

# 7: FALSE TEMPLE
This room contains a giant statue of a hideous snake-man god, resembling a cross between a toad, a heap of intestines, and a melted candle. Water leaking into the tomb has eroded the floor, revealing a secret passage under the statue to LEVEL 2 of the dungeon.

## Lessons: there are secret passages. They are associated with statues. This might be a false tomb. Throughout this dungeon, statues will be associated with secret passages and treasure.

# 8: SECRET PASSAGE
This damp, narrow room lies directly below 7: FALSE TEMPLE. It is an alcove-like passage that widens to become 9: STATUE HALL.
